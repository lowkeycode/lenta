        <h1 class="post__title">Revisit A Landscape For Another Shot Or Not?
        </h1>

        <br>

        <p class="post__p"><span class="post__ital">Is it worth it to go back to a photography location, or best to adventure on and explore new unknown places? -</span> Many landscape photographers find themselves facing this question at least at one point or another.
        </p>


        <p class="post__p">
            Anytime you grab your gear and go out on another adventure the location will always need to be planned. Did you get the most out of your shoot last time? Or did you see a special angle that would be perfect at a certain light? Is it worth it to go back? In this article we will discuss the pros and cons that will help you make a decision next time you find yourself asking this question.

        <h2 class="post__heading">Revisiting A Location</h2>

        <br>

        <p class="post__p">
            The biggest draw for us to return to a beloved area is that we have the artistic eye the notice how an incredible landscape may look even more beautiful... <span class="ital">under the perfect conditions</span>. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case on our first visit. Sometimes it becomes a chase and even times an obsession, to catch the perfect shot that you know is there if everything would just align in your favor.

        <br>

        <p class="post__p">Through years of chasing these perfect moments I've learned two things. Patience. And most of all persistance. Revisiting during all different conditions; stormy, sunny, sundown, summer, fall, winter will all provide a massively different take on the landscape.</p>

        <p class="post__p">The more you revisit, the more chance you have at getting that perfect photo that you have envisioned. But don't take it to heart if you don't get it that shot the first, second or even third time around. Photography is a labor of love. If it was easy everyone would do it</p>

        <h2 class="post__heading">To Wrap It Up...</h2>

        <br>

        <p class="post__p">Returning to a location make you intimately familiar with it. You will see things the second and third time around that you didn't the first. You can explore the area more, giving you more time and a sense of relaxation instead of feeling rushed for that perfect shot. You have more time to think about the landscape, your shot and will be more prepared for the shot you want. You will get out what you put in when chasing your shot.</p>
